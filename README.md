This repo is about how you generate the vulnerability test for you local pc and providing solutions for the crisis you have.

## What is vulnerability test?
- A vulnerability test is a methodical approach to identifying, evaluating, and analyzing weaknesses or security vulnerabilities present in computer systems, networks, applications, or other digital assets.
- Its primary objective is to proactively reveal flaws that could be taken advantage of by attackers, including unpatched software, insecure configurations, weak encryption, or application vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
- The procedure typically employs automated scanning tools, manual penetration testing, code reviews, and configuration analysis, yielding actionable insights to enhance security prior to the occurrence of attacks.

## How to get vulnerability test report of your pc?
- Use can use OpenVAS or Nessus Vulnerability test applicaton to generate your report. [Both are free for generating reports]

## Common crisis and risks found during vulnerability test
| Common Risks and Vulnerabilities           | Description                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Injection Flaws                            | Malicious inputs executing unintended commands or queries (e.g., SQL injection).                |
| Broken Authentication                      | Weak authentication mechanisms allowing account compromise.                                   |
| Sensitive Data Exposure                    | Inadequate protection of sensitive data like passwords and personal info.                      |
| Security Misconfiguration                  | Improper security settings exposing weaknesses.                                               |
| Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)                 | Injection of malicious scripts into web pages.                                                |
| Insecure Deserialization                   | Risks from deserializing untrusted data leading to code execution.                            |
| Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities| Use of outdated or vulnerable third-party libraries or software.                              |
| Insufficient Logging and Monitoring        | Poor detection of breaches or suspicious activity.                                           |
| Malware Threats                            | Includes viruses, ransomware, cryptojacking, fileless malware.                               |
| Social Engineering Attacks                 | Phishing, business email compromise, and other manipulative attacks.                         |
| Network Attacks                           | Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Man-in-the-Middle (MitM), etc.                         |
| IoT Vulnerabilities                       | Insecure firmware, weak authentication in IoT devices.                                      |
| Supply Chain Attacks                      | Compromise of third-party vendors affecting many organizations.                              |
| Cloud Security Issues                     | Misconfigurations and poor access controls on cloud services.                                |
| Insider Threats                          | Malicious or accidental risks from internal staff.                                          |

## Most critical risk in my pc is:


	macOS 15.x < 15.7 Multiple Vulnerabilities 
  - Severity: Critical CVSS v3.0 
  - Score: 9.8 (highest severity)
  - Description: Multiple critical security vulnerabilities detected in macOS versions older than 15.7.
  - Solution: Update macOS to the latest supported version to patch these vulnerabilities.
